# End-To-End Machine Learning Project

## Objective
> Work through an example project end to end, pretending to be a recently hired data scientist at a real estate company. 

## Steps

### High level steps: 

#### 1. Look at the big picture
- [ ] 1.1 - Define the objective in business terms. 
- [ ] 1.2 - How will the solution be used?
- [ ] 1.3 - What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
- [ ] 1.4 - How would you frame the problem (supervised, unsupervised, reinforced learning, online/offline, etc)
- [ ] 1.5 - How should performance be measured?
- [ ] 1.6 - Is the performance aligned with the business objective? 
- [ ] 1.7 - What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective? 
- [ ] 1.8 - What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools? 
- [ ] 1.9 - Is human expertise available? 
- [ ] 1.10 - How would you solve the problem manually? 
- [ ] 1.11 - List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.
- [ ] 1.12 - Verify assumptions if possible. 

#### 2. Get the data
- [ ] 2.1 - List the data you need and how much you need. 
- [ ] 2.2 - Find and document where you can get the data. 
- [ ] 2.3 - Check how much space it will take. 
- [ ] 2.4 - Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary
- [ ] 2.5 - Get access authorizations
- [ ] 2.6 - Create a workspace 
- [ ] 2.7 - Get the data
- [ ] 2.8 - Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data integrity)
- [ ] 2.9 - Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g. anonymized)
- [ ] 2.10 - Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.) 
- [ ] 2.11 - Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping)

3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms
5. Select a model and train it
6. Fine-tune your model 
7. Present your solution 
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system
